<metadata><idinfo><native> Version 6.0 (Build 6000) ; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.2.2.1350</native><descript><abstract>NLA_Sites_Sampled_DrainageBasins (shapefile) represents the drainage basins for the lakes that were sampled under the USEPA National Lake Assessment (NLA).   In this context, the term drainage basins refers to the land area that drains to an NLA lake.   Each drainage basin contained in the file is represented by a single polygon.</abstract><purpose>The basin delineations created for the sites in the National Lakes Survey are essential to the categorization of watershed/basin size, location, land use and watershed characteristics.  These classifications will be used against the data collected in the field sampling to draw conclusions as to what characteristics contribute to particular values we see in the Lakes Survey.</purpose><supplinf>The input to the drainage basin delineation process was a shapefile of points that represent the lakes sampled during the National Lake Assessment Survey.  The point file contains 1159 points, each one representing a single lake in the survey.  The second input to the process was the NHDPlus, Version 01.  A number of NHDPlus components were used including:  NHDFlowline (the stream network), NHDWaterbody (lake/ponds and other NHD waterbody feature types), Catchment (rough catchments built from 30x30 meter raster cells), CatchmentSP (smoothed catchments built from 30x30 meter raster cells using the "Simplify Polygon" option), fac (flow accumulation grid), and fdr (flow direction grid).  Documentation for the NHDPlus is available from (ftp://ftp.horizon-systems.com/NHDPlus/documentation/NHDPLUS_UserGuide.pdf).    

Finally, an ESRI ArcGIS Online service of TOPO maps was used for visual reference (http://services.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/services) to locate lakes and lake pourpoints when the input lake points were indeterminate.  

For the purposes of drainage basin delineation, the lake points were divided into two classifications:  "On-network" or "Isolated".    
       - "On-network" means that the lake point represents an NHDPlus.NHDWaterbody lake/pond feature which is on the NHDPlus network of flowlines with known flow direction (i.e. the NHDPlus stream network).   All "On-Network" lake drainage basins were delineated beginning at the lake pourpoint as represented by the NHDPlus stream network.  The reachcode and measure on the stream network line that represents the lake pourpoint was determined and used in the NHDPlus Basin Delineation Tool to derive the drainage basin.  The Basin Delineation Tool split the starting catchment at the pourpoint and merged the results with the collection of smoothed catchments gathered through an upstream-with-tributaries navigation.  All holes in the drainage basin created by NHDPlus isolated networks were filled as long as the NHDPlus did not recognize a sink at the bottom of the isolated network.  
     - "Isolated" means that the lake point represents an NHDPlus.NHDWaterbody lake/pond which is not on the NHDPlus stream network.  All "Isolated" lake drainage basins were delineated with the ArcGIS 9.2 Spatial Analyst-&gt;Hydrology-&gt;Watershed tool.  The input to the Watershed tool was a rasterized NHDPlus lake polygon and the NHDPlus flow direction grid.  The resulting watershed raster was converted to a polygon shape using the "Simplify Polygon" option.  

The classification process that placed lake points into one of the two classifications above was automated as much as possible with a visual method being used for lake points that could not be classified in an automated way.  The process was as follows:  
Step 1. The lake points were intersected with the NHDPlus.NHDWaterbody features.  For each lake point that was contained in an NHDPlus.NHDWaterbody, the reachcode of the NHDWaterbody was associated with the lake point.    
Step 2. For each lake point which received a reachcode from step 1, the NHDPlus.NHDWaterbody features with that reachcode were gathered together.  Note:  Some waterbodies in NHDWaterbody are split by quad lines, however, in most cases, these waterbody pieces have the same reachcode and can therefore can be combined into the whole waterbody.  All NHDPlus.NHDFlowline features inside the collection of NHDWaterbody features was used to select a pourpoint for the lake reach.  The NHDFlowline with the lowest hydrologic sequence number was selected as the lake outlet and its downstream measure was used as the point location of the pourpoint.   

After step 2, there were 851 lake points identified as "On-Network".  The drainage basins for these lakes were delineated as described above.  There were 308 lake points remaining after the above steps.  These lake points did not fall within any NHDPlus.NHDWaterbody lake/pond feature.  All of the 308 lake points were examined visually to determine their classification.  Where possible lake point names, NHDPlus.NHDWaterbody names and USGS TOPO maps names were used to confirm a match.  In this manner, each lake point was classified as "On-Network" or "Isolated".  Following the visual classification, the 308 lake drainage basins were delineated according to the methods described above.</supplinf></descript><citation><citeinfo><origin>US Environmental Protection Agency</origin><pubdate>20081008</pubdate><title>NLA_Sites_Sampled_DrainageBasins_Ver2</title><pubinfo><publish>U.S. EPA Office of Water (OW) - Office of Wetlands Oceans &amp; Watersheds (OWOW)</publish><pubplace>Washington, DC</pubplace></pubinfo><geoform>vector digital data</geoform><onlink>\\AA\ORD\COR\Data\Priv\ARM Data\NLA 2007\GIS layers Analysis\National_Basin_withMetrics_20120920</onlink></citeinfo></citation><timeperd><current>publication date</current><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>20081008</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>As needed</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-124.690365</westbc><eastbc>-67.685018</eastbc><northbc>49.739030</northbc><southbc>26.047430</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>EPA GIS Keyword Thesaurus</themekt><themekey>Lakes</themekey><themekey>Surface Water</themekey><themekey>Sites</themekey><themekey>Monitoring</themekey><themekey>Assessment</themekey><themekey>Water Quality</themekey><themekey>Statistical Survey</themekey><themekey>Probability</themekey><themekey>Lake Drainage Basin</themekey></theme><place><placekt>None</placekt><placekey>United States (US) (USA)</placekey><placekey>Alabama</placekey><placekey>Arizona</placekey><placekey>Arkansas</placekey><placekey>California</placekey><placekey>Colorado</placekey><placekey>Connecticut</placekey><placekey>Delaware</placekey><placekey>Florida</placekey><placekey>Georgia</placekey><placekey>Idaho</placekey><placekey>Illinois</placekey><placekey>Indiana</placekey><placekey>Iowa</placekey><placekey>Kansas</placekey><placekey>Kentucky</placekey><placekey>Louisiana</placekey><placekey>Maine</placekey><placekey>Maryland</placekey><placekey>Massachusetts</placekey><placekey>Michigan</placekey><placekey>Minnesota</placekey><placekey>Mississippi</placekey><placekey>Missouri</placekey><placekey>Montana</placekey><placekey>Nebraska</placekey><placekey>Nevada</placekey><placekey>New Hampshire</placekey><placekey>New Jersey</placekey><placekey>New Mexico</placekey><placekey>New York</placekey><placekey>North Carolina</placekey><placekey>North Dakota</placekey><placekey>Ohio</placekey><placekey>Oklahoma</placekey><placekey>Oregon</placekey><placekey>Pennsylvania</placekey><placekey>Rhode Island</placekey><placekey>South Carolina</placekey><placekey>South Dakota</placekey><placekey>Tennessee</placekey><placekey>Texas</placekey><placekey>Utah</placekey><placekey>Vermont</placekey><placekey>Virginia</placekey><placekey>Washington</placekey><placekey>West Virginia</placekey><placekey>Wisconsin</placekey><placekey>Wyoming</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>Please confirm that you are using the most recent copy of both data and metadata.
